1. System fonts are fonts already installed on your device or computer. They aren't necessarily available for use by the web. Web fonts are server-hosted fonts; they can show up on your device even if you don't have them specifically installed, as long as the page is programmed correctly. Web-safe fonts are fonts that all computer systems should already have. Using them can reduce loading time because the computer won't have to summon them from elsewhere for them to appear.

2. It's important to have fallback fonts in case a client's computer can't load your first choice. Also, not just having the fallbacks, but choosing them carefully, is important because if one is having issues loading and then is replaced by another, the effect can be jarring to see.

3. I started this assignment by choosing the piece of writing I would use. Then I set up my homework files and put the content into my html document. I started the homework walk-through and followed along, pausing it periodically to add or tweak things in my assignment. I thought this assignment went much faster for me; I struggle a lot more with other parts of designing. In the "CSS Diner" exercise, there were certain levels I just could NOT get past and I'm still not sure why :(
