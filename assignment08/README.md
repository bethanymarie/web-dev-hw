1. Everything about learning Html was new to me. Our first few assignments I thought it was so gratifying to see the code translated into something visible in the browser, and I even thought it was kind of easy. As we progressed, I still find it gratifying but no longer easy and it takes me a LONG time to complete the assignments.

2. I'm excited about the CSS portion of the class because I want to keep gaining understanding of how all this code becomes a beautiful site. I am anxious about how much time it will take at first but I have a much better idea of what sort of time a need to allot myself in order to get through an assignment and not get frustrated. I tend to sit and do assignments in one swoop but I think I won't be able to do that moving forward. I'll need to step away and come back to it at least once or twice.

3. My workflow for this was similar to what it's been - I'll watch the walkthrough and add basic elements I'm more comfortable with, then build from there. I had a super hard time adding images and sizing them for this assignment. In the index.html, I created each div, then wrote the text for each one, then added the images. But it took forever.
