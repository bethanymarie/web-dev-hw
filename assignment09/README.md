1. The universal selector types style all elements on a page - for example, using the * key and then following with a font attribute or background color will apply that to all text that appears and the entire background. The element selector is to style only certain elements, for example h1 would style all h1 elements that appear on the page. Class selectors will style any elements that have been given a certain class - for example if you have 2 divs and they both are classified as "rectangle," and you wish to make them both blue, then you could specify their class, "rectangle," and any attributes you include will be done to them both. Last, the id selector is to style only elements that have a certain id given to them. Ids should be unique to each element, so any attributes you include here will be done to this element only. You want to always choose selectors based on which elements you want to reflect your change/style, so when you are writing your HTML you should be thinking about style and group or Id your elements accordingly.

2. Oops, I chose four colors for some reason. I think it was because I was following along with the walk-through so I made four boxes as well. I chose my palette after browsing pictures online of interiors from my chosen decade. Two colors I left alone and just used their name - brown and orange. For the other two, I used a green hue: #16cd22, and a yellow hue: #f5ec15.
