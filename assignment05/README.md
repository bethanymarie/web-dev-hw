A page can have one head element and one body element - they are different in that the content of the head is not visible to readers and the body content is visible. The head provides information to the browser about the page, and the body is your content.

Structural markup has to do with the layout of elements on the page, while semantic markup adds meaning to the content that is laid out.

My work cycle isn't very sophisticated or organized yet. I started with making the homework tree and adding all the elements to my index file. Then I basically went down the homework description list and added in the items one at a time.
