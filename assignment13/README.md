1. My imaginary client is a friend of mine who does woodworking as a hobby. Snapywood is the real name of his "company," although he doesn't really run it as a business. I imagined he wanted a simple website that was visually appealing, easy to navigate and kind of masculine.

2. block elements display vertically, while inline elements show on one line (horizontally). inline-block takes away new lines, but they will fill their parent container horizontally so you have to set specific widths.

3. My workflow for this assignment was all over the place. I wasn't very organized and should have used notes to section my stylesheet like I saw in the video. I cobbled this assignment together very slowly, I'm sorry it's so late! I'm still working out how things are related to each other on the page. ESPECIALLY div positioning. I don't think everything on the page is styled as I would like, but some things started to make more sense to me by the end of this assignment.
