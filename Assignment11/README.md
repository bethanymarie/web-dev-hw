1. Padding is the space between the content f an element - say some text or an image - and the edge of the element itself. Margin is the space between the box element and the edge of its parent element, or space between it and other elements. A border is more of a visual style that helps define an element, rather than manage the space it takes up.

2. My work flow always consists of me following along with the video to start, but I tried not to do it exactly this time and to just play around more with the different directions. Though I think I understand the concepts fairly well, I can't say that all of them are put to best use the way I implemented them, for example my floating element is just kind of sitting there and I can't tell if its functioning or not.
