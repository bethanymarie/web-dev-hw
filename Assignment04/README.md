I used the Wayback Machine to go to the National Geographic website in 2001 and in 2010. In 2001, it was a black background with all the content arranged in the center. It's basically a collection of headings, pictures and links, with a very little unclickable text. The photo links are mostly all broken at this point. The 2010 version didn't look all that much more advanced. They both resembled the layout of print media, really. Today's website is nothing like that; it's full of very large pictures, some of which move, and you have to scroll a lot longer to get to the bottom.

 What DIDN'T I learn in the GIT module? It was gratifying to see the text and tags materialize on the web, and gave me some basic understanding of how sites are built, which I had zero understanding of before. I think what will continue to be challenging is keeping the information straight and feeling like I have a flow. I still feel that I'm heavily reliant on the walk-throughs, and every week is review for me.
