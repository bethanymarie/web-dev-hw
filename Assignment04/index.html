      Everyone I have lost
      in the closing of a door
      the click of the lock
      is not forgotten, they
      do not die but remain
      within the soft edges
      of the earth, the ash
      of house fires and cancer
      in sin and forgiveness
      huddled under old blankets
      dreaming their way into
      my hands, my heart
      closing tight like fists.
