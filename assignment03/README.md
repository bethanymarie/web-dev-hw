When you call up a webpage by typing in the URL, a request is sent to the server where that page lives. The resulting files are sent back to you through whatever browser you are using. The browser uses various elements - user interface, rendering engine, browser engine, the network, programming language, and date storage - to interpret these files so they display properly by the time they get to you.

A markup language is the use of specific symbols/words etc. that you add to a plain text file in order for that file to display properly on the web. the most common one used in web development is hyper text markup language, or HTML.
